# CODE CHALLANGE 02_04

## Instructions

Your challenge is to change the Subscribable DirectChannel implementation that we built in 02_02 into a Subscribable PublishSubscribeChannel implementation.

This way we can consume the same Channel broadcast message by two different subscribers.

Start in the spring configuration file named `tech-support.xml`. On line 13 you will find instructions and a hint.

Then move to ViewService.java:31 and TechSupportService.java:24, for more instructions and hints.

When you are done, start the application and open your browser to `http://localhost:9090`. In your system out console, ou should see a system log message generated by TechSupportService.java:57. You should also see the current build stamp `CH.02_04` reflected in the user inteface.
