# CODE CHALLENGE 03_04

## Instructions

Your challenge is to add a ServiceActivator to the message flow so that our statusMonitor channel will automatically cause a customer account credit to be applied.

This way the account credit functionality can be activated as a by-product of the existing message flow, without manual invocation inside our business logic.

These supporting classes have been supplied

* CustomerAccountService.java

Your ServiceActivator should respond to messages on the statusMonitor channel. It should invoke the creditCustomerAccount() method of the CustomerAccountService class. No reply messaging is required.

Start in the spring configuration file named `status-monitor.xml`. On line 24 you will find additional instructions and hints.

Files you will need to alter for this challenge

* status-monitor.xml

To test your work, run the tests in 

* DashboardApplicationTests.java

Once your tests are successful, start the application and open your browser to `http://localhost:9090`. In your system out console, you should see a system log message generated by CustomerAccountService.java:23. You should also see the (simulated) account credit balance accumulating in the user interface.

Congrats! Thanks Spring Integration's ServiceActivator implementation, you have successfully achieved a significant business process invocation with very little development effort required. You have also practiced applying technical directives using the official Spring Integraton technical documentation.
