# CODE CHALLENGE 02_04

## Instructions

Your challenge is to change the Subscribable DirectChannel implementation that we built in 02_02 into a Subscribable PublishSubscribeChannel implementation.

This way we can consume the same Channel broadcast message by two different subscribers.

Start in the spring configuration file named `tech-support.xml`. On line 13 you will find instructions and a hint.

Then move to these files for more instructions and hints.

* ViewService.java:31  
* TechSupportService.java:24  
* DashboardManager:64

(You will need to alter 4 files in total.)

When you are done, start the application and open your browser to `http://localhost:9090`. In your system out console, you should see a system log message generated by TechSupportService.java:57. You should also see the current build stamp `CH.02_04` reflected in the user interface.

Congrats! Thanks to the multi-broadcast capabilities of a PublishSubscribeChannel, now you have two different system responses to a single message send event.
